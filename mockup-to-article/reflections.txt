Your response goes here!

These skills were all I have already learned, however it was good review and practice.
Since this isn't my first time using HTML it was fairly easy.
I have been googling syntax that I am not too familiar with as well as reading up on new documentation. For example, I didn't know how to create a horizontal line so a quick google search yielded great results.
